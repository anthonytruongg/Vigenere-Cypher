# Vigenere-Cypher

Vigenere Cypher project for CIS-7 Discrete Structures Class.

# Case Project Details

Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigenère square or Vigenère table. The table consists of the alphabets written out 26 times in different rows, each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet, corresponding to the 26 possible Caesar
Ciphers. At different points in the encryption process, the cipher uses a different alphabet from one of the rows.
The alphabet used at each point depends on a repeating keyword

## Example

Input (in plain text): "GEEKSFORGEEKS"
Keyword: "AYUSH"
Output (cipher text): "GCYCZFMLYLEI"

# Project Prompt

- Create a C++ Program that will encrypt and decrypt a message from the user.
- Test the program to veryify output is accurate. Assess any program limitations.
- Provide proper documentation on programming approach for this project. Documentation should express understanding of encryption and decryption in a teamwork setting.

# Installation

Install via local terminal.

# Documentation

## Goals

- What problems are you solving in this project?
- What is the program objectives? Explain how your program is interacting with the user and its purpose.

## Solution

- What solutions are you implementing in the project?

## Calculations and Algorithm

- Provide explanation of calculations and algorithm implementation.
- How is discrete structures implemented in the C++ program?

## Issues

- What are the limitations of the program?
- Provide recommendation on improving the limitations of the program.

# Flowchart / Pseudocode

- Write the pseudocode for the program, from start to finish. Be sure to include decision-making branching.
- If you choose to do flowchart, use standard shapes for flowchart, be sure to include decision-making branching. You can use web-based tool such as Draw.io to build your flowchart.
