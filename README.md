## General Description
In this project, Team "Gigga Lyte," comprising Anthony Truong and Nour Siwar, will collaborate to complete the following assignment for the CIS 7 Discrete Structures class. Our objective is to demonstrate the practical application of the concepts we have learned throughout the semester, enabling us to solve specific problems that necessitate the use of mathematical techniques.

Given the above description of the Vigenère cipher, create a C++ program that encrypts and decrypts a message from the user. Test the program to verify that the output is accurate. Assess program limitations and provide documentation that entails programming approach for encryption and decryption.

## Problems
The problems associated with this project primarily pertain to user security. Given that the purpose of this program is to assist users in encrypting their sensitive information, the most significant challenge lies in employing appropriate and efficient encryption and decryption methods. Failing to implement the proper encryption program would render user information vulnerable to public access.

Specifically, the problems are:
1. How will this program encrypt user information?
2. How will this program decrypt user information?
3. What are the program’s limitations?

## Programming Approach
In order to create a program that encrypts and decrypts user information, the team will approach this project with the idea of a Vigenere Cipher in mind. The project does state that the Vigenere Cipher encryption method must be implemented, and so this will be the backbone of our solution to the given prompt.

Solutions:
1. Create a user interface for user accessibility.
2. Use encryption formula to encrypt information.
3. Use decryption formula to decrypt information.

## Instructions to use
1. Use an IDE such as Microsoft Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code (VSC).
2. Clone this repo using: git clone https://github.com/anthonytruongg/Vigenere-Cypher.git
3. Make sure your IDE supports the C++ language by using a C++ IDE or downloading extensions if necessary.
4. Run program and have fun!
